## About this site

Founded to provide a simple online cookbook without ads and obese web design.

### It's easy to contribute!

- Submit new recipes using git via [GitHub](https://github.com/stillundecided/based.cooking).
- You may also improve recipes or add an image to those without them.
- Donate to the individual people who contribute pages whose names are at the bottom of each page.

### Donate to the VegBased.Cooking maintenance fund

We are funded by you only, not 20MB of ads or privacy-violating trackers per page.
